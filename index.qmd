## Goals

Hi, My Name is Hannah! I'm a Master's student in the MCBS Department! Structural Biochemistry is totally my jam!I work on the inactivation proteins in the visual transduction pathway, including RGS9, R9AP and GB5L! Other than science, I like to Rock Climb, Read, and Cook! My favorite food to bake is Banana Bread! A few fun facts are: I can sail (like boats), I drink an ungodly amount of coffee everyday and I've been rock climbing in Estonia!

## Education

Undergrad - Siena College - Major - Biology, Minor - Chemistry Grad - Master's in Biochemistry

## Experience

I've been to 9 countries! (ten in November!). I love to listen to the Buttertones and the Plumbs. I'm watching Downton Abbey right now.
